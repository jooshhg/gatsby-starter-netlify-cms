    Life Presents us with both problems and mysteries. 

    For instance : The problems with Sex and The Mysteries of Romance; 

    Educate the Mystery of “Romance” away, and you’re just left with the problem of “Sex”.

    (In the Process you trade “Love” for “Lust” ).

    So , What is sex education all about? 

    Does it not destroy one of the great Mysteries of life,

    and in so doing build a cultural foundation for Promiscuity

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
